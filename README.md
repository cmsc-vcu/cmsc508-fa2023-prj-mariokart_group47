# Welcome to Semester Project repository

We created a database for the game ***Mario Kart 8*** and the main focus was to allow people to see all the different kinds of stats that the characters, vehicles, wheels, and glider have. 
Normally, you are not able to see the stats of any character when choosing. However, this database will alllow the player to see each individual stat in an efficient way to ultimately create a more easier and fun way of playing the game!
